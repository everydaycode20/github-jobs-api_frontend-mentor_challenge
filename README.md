# GitHub Jobs API Frontend Mentor challenge

Although I didn't have a Frontend Mentor pro account to access this (premium) challenge I still wanted to make this challenge to practice React.
I've used the most basic Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef) and Context API to toggle from light mode to dark mode and vice versa.
